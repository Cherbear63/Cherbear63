Im the founder of Pawfect Grooming And Pet Handling School.
I can up with a program to help people of dis advantage circumstances through the pet therapy.  In our program we educate them to be successful in the animal industry.  Our main goal with the program is for every military student to be able to take a program to train their own serve pet to be certified though AKC.  We have already made the first step of this goal by being able to access military education pay from students enrolled in services.  We are working closely with Veteran Chamber Of Commerce and Voc Rehab.  Im reaching out hoping we can form a great partnership to help more people with this program.  Thanks I hope you have a wonderful day and thank you for your dedication to help those who need help live more fulfilled happy lives.  Thanks for your attention.
 
 
   Being a person who struggles with disabilities and i have went though many challenges and trails.  Although it may have been very difficult at the time im thankful because it has helped me become who Iam today!  I still want to help save lifes with the help of animals.  I know they can help and I wont give up!  I cant because I have 4 students enrolled in my project depending on me!  In addition to that Sir, Im the mother of 4 beautiful daughters im trying to raise!  They all struggle with some disabilities.  My youngest Cherish Has the most difficult she has Autisum.  I think I might too!  this doest stop me! I dont want it to stop anyone! I want to teach everyone they can achieve their dreams and goals no matter how many times you fall you just gotta get back in the saddle.  Im enrolled in a Business class to help me be better at running a business and be better with technology.  I have been practicing my life improvement skills. I wanted to just reach out so thank you for all you have done for our country, myself included!  I wanted to show you what I have been working on really hard!  I hope you can see the improvements I have made.  I will continue to work on them and I wont give up because of you and many others!

  Im reaching out to apply for  for the project Knowledge AndInnovation for Supporting Teach Professional Development Agency And Well-Being.  I know this program I have formulated will be very impactful to anyone who Has any type of illness or Trauma.  The materials I have choosen to implement in my curriculum are Visual, and easy to understand.  The othe impactful method is hands on training.  This also can be utilized with our online program.  Where they will be instucted through zoom.  the stdents will have to submit videos of the work they do on animals.  The main reason this program is a guatatee successful program that will help them with their over all well-being through pet therapy.  We will also teach them lessions on the beifits of essential oils, and accupressure.  We will also include healthy and happy skills to help them live a more fulfilled life of success.  Our company found the perfect location for our facility.  Where we can actually provide them with a healthy place to reside.  That will be equiped with a housing unit.  I think many people of any back ground would benifit from the education program.  In adition to all the above listed wonderful qualities we will also be conducting research of the pets, to find out who they are capable of doing to contribute to the health industry.  Along with the unique abilities they have and have been a secret.  We will be researching pets anatomy, and what they can sense or smell.
